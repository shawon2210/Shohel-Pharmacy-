# holaOS

holaOS is an open agent computer for any digital work. It reimagines the computer as a shared environment where humans and AI agents operate side by side—with full access to the same browser, files, and apps, like collaborating with a powerful teammate that continuously learns how to work better with you. Instead of working across disconnected tools and contexts, everything lives in one place where memory, execution, and goals remain coherent, so work doesn’t reset or lose state. Agents operate continuously within this environment, evolving over time while remaining fully inspectable, and can be shaped by you through roles and templates to support consistent, repeatable ways of working.

## Quick Start

### One-Line Install

For a fresh-machine bootstrap on macOS, Linux, or WSL, use the repository installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holaboss-ai/holaOS-priv/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --launch
```

You can also follow the manual path if you want to control each setup step.

## Manual Install

You likely will not need this section because One-Line Install runs the same setup. Use Manual Install when you want to inspect or control each step. If you use the manual path, verify the usual prerequisites first:

```bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

### One-Line Agent Setup

If you use Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or another coding agent, you can hand it the setup instructions in one sentence:

```text
Run the holaOS install script from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/holaboss-ai/holaOS-priv/main/scripts/install.sh. It should install git and Node.js 24.14.1/npm if they are missing, clone or update the repo into ~/holaboss-ai unless I specify another --dir, run desktop:install, create desktop/.env from desktop/.env.example if needed, run desktop:prepare-runtime:local and desktop:typecheck, and only run desktop:dev if I ask for --launch. If Electron cannot open, stop after verification and tell me the next manual step.
```

That handoff keeps the installation flow self-contained while leaving the detailed bootstrap steps in the repo-local [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) runbook.

This is the baseline installation flow for local desktop development.

1. Install the desktop dependencies from the repository root:

```bash
npm run desktop:install
```

2. Create your local environment file:

```bash
cp desktop/.env.example desktop/.env
```

If you are following the repo exactly, keep the file close to the template and only change the values that your provider or machine needs.

3. Prepare the local runtime bundle:

```bash
npm run desktop:prepare-runtime:local
```

4. If you want a quick validation pass before launching Electron, run:

```bash
npm run desktop:typecheck
```

5. Start the desktop app in development mode:

```bash
npm run desktop:dev
```

The `predev` hook will validate the environment, rebuild native modules, and make sure a staged runtime bundle exists.

If you want to stage the runtime before opening the desktop app, there are two common paths:

Build from local runtime:

```bash
npm run desktop:prepare-runtime:local
```

Fetch the latest published runtime:

```bash
npm run desktop:prepare-runtime
```

Use the local path when you are actively changing runtime code. Use the published bundle when you want to verify the desktop against a known release artifact.

Use `One-Line Install` when you want the fastest path to a working local desktop environment. Use `Manual Install` when you need to inspect or control each setup step yourself.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, start with [Start Developing](https://www.holaos.ai/docs/contribute/start-developing) to get the local desktop and runtime loop working, then use [Contributing](https://www.holaos.ai/docs/contribute/start-developing/contributing) for validation, commit, and review expectations.
